# Thesis - Spectral Instability of Plasma Flow in Magnetic Nozzle

Known issue of usask latex template:
- floating environments with [htpb!] like positioning cannot placed at the end of a chapter/section/subsection
    - to fix this, either use [H] or placed the floating environments somewhere else

TODO
- [x] sort references by appearance
- [x] compress [1,2,3,4] to [1-4]
- [ ] unify the citation format
