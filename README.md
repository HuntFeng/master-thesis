# Thesis - Spectral Instability of Plasma Flow in Magnetic Nozzle

Known issue of usask latex template:
- floating environments with [htpb!] like positioning cannot placed at the end of a chapter/section/subsection
    - to fix this, either use [H] or [htpb] without ! or placed the floating environments somewhere else
