# Thesis - Spectral Instability of Plasma Flow in Magnetic Nozzle

Known issue of usask latex template:
- floating environments with [htpb!] like positioning cannot placed at the end of a chapter/section/subsection
    - to fix this, either use [H] or placed the floating environments somewhere else

TODO
- [x] derive the exact solution instead of verify it
- [x] reference analytical solution to appendix
- [x] add punctuation in formulas
    - [x] introduction
    - [x] fluid equations
    - [x] eigenvalue problem
    - [x] spectral method
    - [x] singular perturbation
    - [x] conclusion
- [x] more description for results
- [ ] revise introduction
