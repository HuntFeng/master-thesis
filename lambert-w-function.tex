\chapter{Lambert $W$ Function} \label{app:lambert-w}
\begin{definition}
    The Lambert $W$ function is a function, $y(x)$, such that the following equation holds
    \[ ye^y = x \]
    where $y$ and $x$ are real. The Lambert $W$ function is denoted as $W_k(x)$, where $k=0,-1$ are its two branches.
