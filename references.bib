              analyses of an arbitrary set of hydrodynamic equations : search for
              steady states ; stability of steady states ; nonlinear integration
              ; search for specified nonlinear solutions; stability of nonlinear
              solutions. The scheme is an extension of the “Henyey” relaxation
              method and is especially useful in problems where both numerical
              stability and mathematical versatility are desired. In particular,
              if Eulerian equations are used, we may use this approach to
              investigate the stability of steady flows.},

              values of velocityand density at an initial time and additionally
              the velocityperturbation at the base of the corona for all times.
              The solution is constructed by linear superposition of normal
              solutions, which contain the time only in an exponential factor.
              The stability problem becomes a singular eigenvalue problem for the
              amplitudes of the velocity and pressure perturbations, since
              additionally to the boundary condition at the base of the corona
              one must add the condition that the amplitudes behave regularly at
              the critical point. It is proved that only stable eigenvaluesexist.

              unanswered were the stability of the steady-state solution, the

              ﬂows would evolve to the steady state, and under what conditions a

  abstract  = {The use of magnetic nozzles (MNs) in electric propulsion (EP)
               systems is investigated analytically and experimentally. MNs have
               the potential to efficiently accelerate propellant without the
               restrictions of electrodes, however, their measured performance has
               been poor compared to existing EP technology. A theoretical model
               was developed to understand the requirements for efficient
               operation. Analytical scaling laws were derived for the mass
               utilization efficiency, channel efficiency, and MN thermal and
               divergence efficiencies, in terms of dimensionless parameters that
               describe the relevant collisional processes in the channel and the
               radial plasma structure at the MN throat. In comparison to previous
               MN thrusters, performance levels comparable to state of the art EP
               systems are only possible if three conditions are met: (1) the
               thruster operates in a high confinement mode, (2) the plume
               divergence is significantly reduced, and (3) electron temperatures
               are increased by an order of magnitude. The final requirement
               implies these thrusters should be operated with heavy propellants
               such as xenon to limit the specific impulse to reasonable values.
               An experiment was designed to investigate the fundamental dynamics
               of plasma flow through a MN. The experiment consists of a helicon
               plasma source and two electromagnetic coils. The plasma parameters
               are determined at a variety of locations using electric probes
               mounted on a positioning system. The existence of a critical
               magnetic field strength for high confinement and the predicted
               scaling of the mass utilization efficiency were verified. Electron
               cooling in the magnetically expanding plasma was observed to follow
               a polytropic law with an exponent that agrees with theory. With
               decreasing magnetic field, a transition from a collimated plume to
               an under-collimated plume was found, where an under-collimated
               plume is defined such that the plume divergence is greater than the
               magnetic field divergence. This transition was accompanied by the
               disappearance of an ion-confining potential well at the plasma
               periphery. Using the potential well as a metric for plasma
               confinement downstream, it is shown that confinement is lost when
               the electrons demagnetize via finite Larmor radius effects. The
               ambipolar ion response to this demagnetization determines the
               difference between the two plume modes.},

We show here that in terms of the relative pressure jump between the coronal base and distant medium the stationary flow solutions follow an hysteresis-type cycle with two catastrophy points: as the pressure of the interstellar medium increases, the termination shock moves closer toward the stellar surface, but when the shock position reaches the sonic point the wind collapses into supersonic accretion with a shock below the critical point. If the pressure of the interstellar medium decreases again, or the pressure at the coronal base increases, the flow can evolve continuously into breeze (everywhere subsonic) accretion, but the flow evolves back into a state characterized by a supersonic shocked wind, once the pressure difference corresponding to a static stratification is exceeded.},

The system is seen to evolve, through the phases of wind, breeze, accretion and back, according to an hysteresis type cycle with two catastrophe points: the value of the external pressure relative to a static atmosphere and that corresponding to the fastest (critical) breeze. This behaviour is proved to be due to the instability of the outflow breeze solutions (due to their unfavourable stratification), while subsonic accretion is stable. A crucial factor of this instability is the position of the outer boundary: if this is placed too close to the base of the atmosphere the inflow/outflow breeze stability is reversed. These simulations confirm a scenario first proposed by Velli (1994).},

We consider successively the quasi-linear inviscid case and the nonlinear dissipative case (shocks). We show that wave reflection is small everywhere even when the WKB approximation breaks down, and conjecture that the same result could hold for radial Alfven waves in a spherically symmetric wind. We show that, after a transient acceleration, outward propagating waves lead to a lower mean wind velocity than in the unperturbed wind, so that the average velocity may become negative below the sonic point, the difference with the standard result that Lagrangian-mean velocities are higher in presence of waves being explained by the drift between reference frames. We propose that negative average velocities might provide a test for the presence of compressive waves close to the sun. We conjecture that, for MHD fluctuations, the net effect of the wave pressure on the wind velocity depends on the importance of compressive components, and that this might play a role in the observed correlation between the mean solar wind velocity and the level of the compressive component in the wave spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Context. The question of the stability of steady spherical accretion has been studied for many years and, recently, the concept of spatial
                  instability has been introduced.
                  Aims. Here we study the perturbations of steady spherical accretion flows (Bondi solutions), restricting ourselves to the case of a self-similar
                  flow, as a case that is amenable to analytic treatment and that is of physical interest. We restrict ourselves further to its acoustic perturbations.
                  Methods. The radial perturbation equation can be solved in terms of Bessel functions. We study the formulation of adequate boundary
                  conditions and decide to use no matter-flux-perturbation conditions (at the Bondi radius and at r = 0). We also consider the problems of initial
                  conditions and time evolution, and concentrate more particularly on radial perturbations.
                  Results. No spatial instability at r = 0 is found. The time evolution is such that perturbations eventually become ergodic-like and show no
                  trace of instability or of acquiring any remarkable pattern.},

The profile is a branch of a quartic equation, relating distance to the central object to, for example, the local sound speed. Two branches of this equation are complex. The other two describe three different types of flow: subsonic and transonic accretion flow, transonic wind, and supersonic, super-Eddington flow. At any position in this flow, a supersonic regime can be linked to a subsonic one, through an adiabatic shock. Given the profiles, the position of this shock is determined and vice versa. A stability criterion is derived for the continuous and shocked flows. },

The equation for sounds in a transonic flow is written into a Schr{\" o}dinger-type equation with a potential barrier, and the quasinormal frequencies are calculated semianalytically. From the results of numerical simulations, it is shown that the quasinormal modes are actually excited when the transonic flow is formed or slightly perturbed, as well as in the real black hole case. In an actual experiment, however, the purely-outgoing boundary condition will not be satisfied at late times due to the wave reflection at the end of the apparatus, and a late-time ringing will be expressed as a superposition of "boxed" quasinormal modes. It is shown that the late-time ringing damps more slowly than the ordinary quasinormal ringing, while its central frequency is not greatly different from that of the ordinary one. Using this fact, an efficient way for experimentally detecting the quasinormal ringing of an acoustic black hole is discussed.},
