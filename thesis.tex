\abstract{
    Spectral method is a common technique for analyzing the instability of a dynamical system. By discretizing the linearized equations motion of magnetic nozzle, the instability problem becomes a polynomial eigenvalue problem. Given Dirichlet boundary condition, we found that the flow with subsonic and supersonic velocity profiles are stable. Given fixed-open boundary condition, the subsonic flow is stable, but the supersonic flow is unstable. Different discretizations, such as finite difference, finite element and spectral element method agree with each other. By studying the convergence of different modes, we successfully eliminated the spurious unstable modes.

    However, spectral method is not enough to analyze the full problem. The problem has a singularity at the throat of the nozzle if the flow is transonic. The existence of singularity prevents the use of spectral method. We then expand the solution at the singularity and found the regular solution. Using that together with shooting method, we are able to solve the polynomial eigenvalue problem. The flow with accelerating velocity profile is stable.
